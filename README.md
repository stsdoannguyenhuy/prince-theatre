## This sample code is using
- [Kotlin language](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [Hilt Dagger Dependency Injection](https://dagger.dev/hilt/)
- [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)
- [RxKotlin](https://reactivex.io/)
- Mockito for unit test
- Android basic layout and components
- Backend API from [challenge api](https://challenge.lexicondigital.com.au/api/v2/filmworld/movies) with `x-api-key` provided

## Source code structure
![project-structure](./documentation/project-structure.jpg)
- `app`: android application instance
- `base`: our base classes, such as `BaseActivity`
- `data`: contains only data class (Pojo, DTO, model...)
- `di`: Dependency Injection
- `repository`: defines get/update/delete actions of object. In this project, that's `FilmRepository`
- `service`: Our business logic should come here

----------
## Testing
### Backend API testing
Call multiple times to [backend api](https://challenge.lexicondigital.com.au/api/v2/{theater}/movies) with provided key by using network tool like `Postman`. I saw some results:
- <span style="color:green">Success 200</span> with data in body. Response body is never changed if code is success
- <span style="color:orange">Forbidden 403</span> if do not pass or pass wrong `x-api-key` in header. Just ignore this case, application always pass the authorized `x-api-key`
- <span style="color:red">Bad Gateway 502 or Internal server error 500</span> sometimes occur. In this case, Prince Theatre application will try 3 times before responsing an error

### Android test `src/androidTest` testing need android device (emulator or real device)
- I don't have much experience on Android testing so I will skip this section
### Unit test `src/test` normal unit test that do not involve android framework
- [Test Report & Coverage](./documentation/test-report.html)
- I don't write unit test under package `com.interview.princethreatre.ui` and generated-code by `dagger`
### Further testing process
- Performance, Crash, User Experience, Usability based on requirement
